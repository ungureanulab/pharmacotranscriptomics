This is a collection of the scripts and files used for analyzing the scRNA-seq data included in the research article _A pharmacotranscriptomics pipeline powered by multiplexed single-cell RNA-sequencing improves pre-clinical drug discovery_ by Dini _et al_. The experiment involved primary high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) cells after treatment with 45 drugs for 24 hours. The compounds encompassed 13 distinct classes of mechanisms of action. Three distinct pre-clinical models underwent scRNA-seq, namely JHOS2 (a HGSOC commercially-available cell line, CVCL_4647), PDC2 and PDC3 (two primary patient samples-derived cancer cell cultures). Duplicates of perturbed cells were available, whereas for each model, six untreated (DMSO) samples were obtained. The scripts encompass pre-processing and analyses, as well as data visualization scripts for the production of plots. The resulting figures can be found in the research article and in the Mendeley data repository. Raw counts are provided with this paper, whereas for privacy concerns, FASTQ files are available upon reasonable request.
