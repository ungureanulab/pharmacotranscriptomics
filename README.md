This is a collection of the scripts used for analyzing the scRNA-seq data included in the research article _A pharmacotranscriptomics pipeline powered by multiplexed single-cell RNA-sequencing improves pre-clinical drug discovery_ by Dini _et al_. The experiment involved primary and metastatic high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) cells after treatment with 45 drugs for 48 hours. The compounds encompassed 13 distinct classes of mechanisms of action. Three distinct pre-clinical models underwent scRNA-seq, namely JHOS2 (a HGSOC commercially-available cell line, CVCL_4647), PDC1 (a metastatic sample), and PDC2 (a primary sample). Duplicates of perturbed cells were available, whereas for each model, six untreated (DMSO) samples were obtained. The scripts encompass pre-processing and analyses, as well as data visualization scripts for the production of plots. If you use these scripts, please cite: ...
